Kitchen etiquette
There are kitchens with all the necessary appliances on every floor of our office. 

For maintaining a comfortable environment, please follow these simple rules:

Do not take food, drinks or dishes if they do not belong to you.
Be tolerant to everyone’s taste in food.
Use the kitchen only for eating. Remember that it’s not a meeting room.
Keep everything clean and in order: do not leave a mess.
If you prefer eating with your friends and you’ve merged the tables, do not forget to split them.
In case you’ve noticed any malfunction of appliances, please notify a facility manager, cleaner or receptionist.
If you run out of condiments/milk/coffee/tea/snacks, please notify a cleaner or receptionist.
Every weekend the fridges are cleaned. Please take away all your food by the end of every Friday. All the leftovers will be utilized.
