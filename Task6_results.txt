Thank you for taking care of yourself and your colleagues!\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic office rules\r\n\r\nKeep noise and distractions to a minimum. Talk on your phone or chat with colleagues in non-working areas or any available meeting room/ one-to-one.\r\nRespect another's need to work and their privacy. Just because others are sitting nearby doesn't mean they are available for conversation at all times. If your colleague appears to be busy, don't disturb him.\r\nBe tolerant. The open-office environment brings together a variety of personalities, with different styles. Be tolerant of these differences and find ways to adapt.\r\nYou should book a workplace, meeting room beforehand. If you need to work from the office, you should book any available working place or meeting room on desk.epam.com. Watch a short video instruction here.\r\nBe tidy. Your messy desk can be a distraction to others and will detract from the professional image of our organization. Ask for a locker cell on the reception desk.\r\nUse your workplace as it was intended. Eat strong scented meals in the kitchen, break room or outside, rather than at your desk. Do not drink alcohol beverages or smoke.\r\nComply with appropriate dress code. Please do not wear clothes with any racist or discriminatory content. Refrain from wearing too short skirt or shorts, as well as clothing that exposes the body too much, etc.\r\nStay home if you are sick. Stay home if you are sick and seek medical assistance. You increase the risk of spreading illness to those around you. Take care of yourself and your colleagues.\r\nWardrobe etiquette\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe is designed for storing outwear during your working day.\r\n\r\nLet's respect each other by following a few obvious rules:\r\n\r\nKeep the wardrobe clean and tidy.\r\n\r\nDo not leave anything other than outwear, headwear and umbrellas.\r\n\r\nDo not use the wardrobe as a storage for your belongings (shoes, gym bags and other clothing and personal items)\r\n\r\nEvery colleague is responsible for their belongings.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative stuff cannot displace or take away any clothes or personal belongings without the permission of the owner.\n  Query:\n  Where can I left my wearing?\n",
